DFT and JTAG

Digital systems (Don't ever call Digital Circuits) differ from Analog circuits in many ways but importantly in 2 ways

Digital systems deals with data transfer unlike Analog circuits where we deal with current and Voltage, hence more complex.

Digital systems volume in the industry standard is much more that of Analog circuits. I am saying this because the number of transistors in Digital system 
and Analog circuits are in the ratio 1000:1 if not more.

Hence to Test this whole Digital System we need an automated method of testing beyond Python Java and C which we call as DFT( Design for Testability).
Manual Testing is practically impossible unlike in Analog circuits.
